problem statement 2
   
X,Y are the two initial positon matrix. A is the matrix such that Xkp=A*X Ykp=A*Y.
delX is the error in measurement of position. delV is the error in measurement of velocity.
P is the process ccovariance matrix. Pkp=A*P*A'.
K is the kalman gain.
K=(Pkp/(Pkp+R))
x and y contains the next measured position and velocity in x and y direction.
Xk=Xkp-K*(x-XKp).
Yk=Ykp-K*(y-YKp).
Xk->X
Pk=(I-K)*Pkp 
Pk->P.
